<p>I'm Arron Mabrey, a twenty-nine year old full-stack software developer.
<a href="http://mabreys.com" target="_blank">Husband to a fun, happy wife. Father of 2 (almost 3) playful children.</a></p>

<p>I try to live life doing what is right. To be as open and honest as I can.</p>

<p>I love craftsmanship. I love listening to people excitedly describe their obsession
whether it be woodworking, the perfect cup of coffee or making knives.</p>

<p>I've had the good fortune of working alongside some of the most talented folks
I've ever meet. Together <em>we've</em> made and shipped great things daily.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I bet at <strong><em>12 years old</em></strong> this kid couldn't be bothered to wear headphones while trying to listen to hip music on his Compact Disc Player.
And he seems ambitious enough to take a handful of money into Radio Shack and walk-out with the needed book, equipment and eletronic components to
build <strong><em>from scratch</em></strong> his own 9-volt powered personal stereo amplifier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a silly story no question about it; but I believe it eloquently describes the kind of person I am <em>and</em> how I go about the problems I aim to solve.</p>

<p>You see I love learning; expanding myself and my experiences, ultimately for the sake of sharing with others.</p>

<p>When I set my mind on something, I find a way to make it work.</p>

<p>Ask anyone who knows me. My number one conversation starter growing up and still to this day is — “Hey look what I just figured out!”</p>

<p>In summary, whether it's in the form of building 9-volt amplifiers, capturing imagery for top brands, or shipping code to hundreds of thousands of users daily.
<strong><em>…I love making things.</em></strong></p>
